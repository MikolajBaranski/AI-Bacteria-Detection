# Agar Bacteria Detection using YOLOv8
## Winning entry of the 2024 Novo Nordisk "Settlers of Agar" hackathon
**Authors: Mikolaj Baranski and Julius Wirbel**

In this repository the winning entry of the competition will be presented alongside the conclusions drawn by the team.

### Context and findings:
#### Competition task:
1. Binary task - detect contaminated agar plate
2. Detection task - count the number of bacterial colonies on the agar plate

##### Context:
Agar plates, commonly used in the biomedical industry, must contain only specific specimens to ensure unbiased results. However, contamination often occurs, leading to unwanted bacterial growth. In industrial settings, where hundreds or even thousands of plates need processing quickly, automated methods for detecting bacterial contamination are essential for maintaining both speed and accuracy.

#### Dataset:
The competition and task was based on the publicaly available [Annotated Germs for Automated Recognition (AGAR)](https://agar.neurosys.com/) dataset.

#### Results:
